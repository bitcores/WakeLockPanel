# WakeLockPanel

This app adds a Panel to compatible Samsung Edge devices that can be used to set a timed or toggled screen on wakelock on the device in order to keep the screen on for a period of time without having to change any settings.
It also includes a widget with the same function for non-Edge based devices including all other manufacturers, from Android 4.0.3 IceCream Sandwich up.
